            review="From the moment I started working with Lavanya from Even, my fitness journey has been a remarkable experience. Her expertise and careful guidance have allowed me to regain my strength and get back into shape without any injuries or setbacks.

            review="My first experience with Even care. Had a fall, called Even's emergency team. In 5 minutes, connected with a Physician. He prescribed an X ray. The team enabled scanner for payments. Got the X ray done and the Even team enabled scanner for an offline OPD visit with a Orthopaedic. The entire process was seamless. The even care expert remained in conversation on chat throughout the entire process. Have never experienced insurance like this before. Truly amazing. Thanks Even."

            review="I bought Even 3 months back, but last week was the first time I used it. I booked a consultation for constant back pain. The process was as easy as they advertise. Everything was done through the app and I didnâ€™t have to run around much. They were happy to arrange my tests at work, which was very unusually convenient for me since I live Bangalore. Right from my tests to consultation, everything fortunately was good. For the first time, experience was smooth. Iâ€™ll update the review after my follow ups. So far, really good!"

            review="I enrolled for Even 3 months back. My experience with Even has been really smooth and comfortable until now. The sign-up process was easy where Subhajit guided me thoroughly. He answered all my queries patiently. Onboarding process was good too, where the team arranged tests to build the health profiles. Even after onboarding, the consultations and tests are arranged quickly and the team is there 24x7 for assistance. I'm satisfied with the service so far."
